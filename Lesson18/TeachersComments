WOW
And can you imagine that the solution is so easy?
Correct answer: 
SELECT TOP 1 WITH TIES region_name
FROM Employees e JOIN Departments d ON dep.department_id=emp.department_id
	JOIN Locations l ON d.location_id=l.location_id
	JOIN Countries c ON l.country_id=c.country_id
	JOIN Regions r ON c.region_id=r.region_id 
GROUP BY region_name
ORDER BY COUNT(employee_id) DESC

No subquery needed.

Once again, subquery.
