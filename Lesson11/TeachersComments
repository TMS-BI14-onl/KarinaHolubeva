Both conditions 'when matched' and 'when not matched' can be placed in one merge - there is no need to separate them into different commands.
Also, you have duplicated condition and this duplication is useless:
... on target.Function_name=source.Barbara
when matched and (target.Function_name= source.Barbara)...
