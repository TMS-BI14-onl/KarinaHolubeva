c) -1
You should use the other order for join: Vendor LEFT JOIN ProductVendor.
Also, WHERE clause is not correct. In the example it's said that you should use column from ON condition (FK)

Expected answer:
SELECT Name
FROM Purchasing.Vendor
UNION
SELECT Name
FROM Sales.Store

c)-0.5
Why do you need a WHERE clause?
